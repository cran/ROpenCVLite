## Description

[`ROpenCVLite`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/ROpenCVLite) is a utility package 
that installs [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) within [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org) 
for use by other packages. This package is not a wrapper around [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) 
(it does not provide access to [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) functions in R), 
not is it a computer vision package for [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org). All 
it does is compiling and installing [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) within your 
[`R`](https://cran.r-project.org) installation so that other packages can easily 
find it and compile against it. 

All information about the functioning of this package can be found on its website at:
